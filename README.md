# Hi, I'm Daniel 👋 👨‍💻

Over the years, I built systems, automated workflows, led digital transformation initiatives, and helped businesses operate more efficiently through technology. I'm intentionally building the next chapter of my career: becoming an AI Engineer. Not just someone who uses AI — but someone who designs, builds, and deploys intelligent systems that create real-world impact.

## 🧠 Why AI?

Because it changes leverage.

AI allows small teams to move like large organizations. It turns automation into decision-making. It lets systems adapt instead of just repeat. That shift is where I'm putting my energy.

## 🚀 What I'm Building Toward

I'm working at the intersection of where I've been and where I'm going — RAG pipelines for insurance documents, intelligent agents, and automation that makes the day-to-day work genuinely easier. The kind of tools I wish had existed when I started.

## 🌍 A Few Things That Shaped Me

I grew up in Havana, built my career in the U.S., and earned my **MS in Computer Science from Georgia Tech** while running a full-time technology department. Adaptability isn't a soft skill — it's the whole game. Technology, for me, has never been about complexity. It's always been about impact.
