# Hi, I'm Daniel 👋 👨‍💻

I didn't start my journey trying to become an AI Engineer.
I started by solving problems.

Over the years, I built systems, automated workflows, led digital transformation initiatives, and helped businesses operate more efficiently through technology. What began as curiosity about systems and infrastructure evolved into something deeper — a fascination with intelligent systems that don't just execute, but *learn*.

Today, I'm certified as an **AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer – Associate**, and I'm intentionally building the next chapter of my career: becoming an AI Engineer. Not just someone who uses AI — but someone who designs, builds, and deploys intelligent systems that create real-world impact.

## 🧠 Why AI?

Because it changes leverage.

AI allows small teams to move like large organizations. It turns automation into decision-making. It lets systems adapt instead of just repeat. That shift — from static execution to dynamic intelligence — is what excites me, and it's where I'm putting my energy.

## 🚀 What I'm Building Toward

My focus right now sits at the intersection of where I've been and where I'm going. I'm building RAG pipelines for insurance documents and intelligent automation that makes the day-to-day work of insurance professionals genuinely easier. The kind of tools I wish had existed when I started.

I'm working across AI-powered automation, intelligent agents, applied machine learning, and cloud-based architectures — with a clear goal: building technology that thinks, adapts, and improves how organizations operate.

## 🌍 A Few Things That Shaped Me

I grew up in Havana and built my career in the U.S., which taught me early that adaptability isn't a soft skill; it's the whole game. I earned my **MS in Computer Science from Georgia Tech** while running a technology department full-time, because I believe you finish what you start. I read, I travel, and I stay curious on purpose.

Technology, for me, has never been about complexity. It's always been about impact.
